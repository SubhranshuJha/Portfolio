      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Subhranshu Jha, a passionate and detail-oriented Information Technology student at Government Engineering College, Gandhinagar. With hands-on experience in full-stack web development and a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, I enjoy solving real-world problems through code. I’ve built projects like PaySwift and QuickCart Lite that reflect my skills in React, Node.js, and MongoDB. During my internship at CSRBOX, I applied data analytics to social impact problems, gaining valuable exposure to predictive modeling and storytelling with data. I’m always eager to learn, build, and grow through meaningful tech-driven work.
